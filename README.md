# Sea-Otter-Graphs

The purpose of the project was to create graphs of sea otter statistics in California using openly available data from the United States Geological Survey's ScienceBase. 
The repository contains two python scripts, a CSV file, and a database file. One of the python files is to create an SQL database from the CSV file and the other to create various graphs from the data in the database. The two main libraries used were the Pandas library and the MatPlotLib library. Sqlite3 was used to execute SQL queries in python.
